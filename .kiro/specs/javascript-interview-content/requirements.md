# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive JavaScript interview preparation resource containing 200 interview questions, 100 coding testing questions, and code output analysis questions. The content will be organized in a structured markdown format to help developers prepare for JavaScript technical interviews.

## Glossary

- **Interview_System**: The JavaScript interview preparation markdown document
- **Question_Bank**: Collection of interview questions organized by category
- **Coding_Test**: Programming challenges with solutions and explanations
- **Output_Analysis**: Code snippets with expected output for analysis practice
- **Category_Section**: Organized groupings of related questions by topic
